# Name change
In the past, I've used my alias [@TerminatorNL](https://www.github.com/TerminatorNL) for all game-related work I've done because I was young and was scared of getting doxxed and subsequently scammed.
However, I've grown increasingly annoyed with this title and since then have exposed my name numerous times online. Therefore, this alias is no longer required.

I've moved my account to [@LeonPhilips](https://www.github.com/LeonPhilips) and placed my old account here (This account goes back to 2011).

# Safety
The purpose of this account is to safeguard against malicious actors that take my old alias, and then use my reputation as a means to spread malware through old (and trusted) links of my projects that've been shared on the internet over the course of 14 years.

# TL;DR
Please refer to [@LeonPhilips](https://www.github.com/LeonPhilips) for all my projects.
