# Name change
In the past, I've used my alias [@TerminatorNL](https://www.github.com/TerminatorNL) for all game-related work I've done because I was young and was scared of getting doxxed and subsequently scammed.
However, I've grown increasingly annoyed with this title and since then have exposed my name numerous times online. Therefore, this alias is no longer required.

I've moved my account to [@LeonPhilips](https://www.github.com/LeonPhilips) and placed my old account here (This account goes back to 2011).

# Safety
The purpose of this account is to safeguard against the spread of a malicious actor taking my old alias and using my reputation as a means to spread malware by using old links of my projects that've been shared by others.

Please refer to [@LeonPhilips](https://www.github.com/LeonPhilips) for all my projects.
